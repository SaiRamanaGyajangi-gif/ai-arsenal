❓FAQs

✅ What is BrowseGPT?
BrowseGPT is a Chrome extension powered by GPT (OpenAI) that allows users to control a browser tab using plain English commands. Instead of manually clicking, searching, or navigating websites, you just type or speak commands like:

“Search for the cheapest 16GB RAM laptops on Amazon.”

And it will open the website, perform the search, and navigate on your behalf.

It works like a voice-activated browser assistant—but using text-based instructions.

🔍 Top Use Cases of BrowseGPT
Use Case	Description
🔎 Automated Research	Save hours of clicking and searching by having BrowseGPT do it for you
🛒 E-commerce Shopping	Instantly find products with specific filters (e.g., "Find running shoes under $100 on Flipkart")
✍️ Content Creation	Use it to quickly find citations, statistics, or articles for blog writing
🎓 Education	Students can use it to summarize or search academic resources fast
♿ Accessibility	Helps those with motor disabilities browse more easily
💼 Job Searching	Automate your hunt across job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.

🧪 Real Commands You Can Try
Just type or say the following inside BrowseGPT:

"Search for marketing jobs in New York on LinkedIn."
"Find best electric scooters under $800 on Amazon."
"Look up the latest AI tools on ProductHunt."
"Check software engineer salaries in Germany."
"Read top 3 articles on how to start a Shopify store."
Each command will automatically perform the task on your screen.

🛠 How Does BrowseGPT Work?
It uses OpenAI’s GPT models to understand your intent.

Then it interprets your command and simulates real browser actions:

Typing

Clicking buttons/links

Navigating pages

It works in a dedicated Chrome tab, not the entire browser.

It follows a step-by-step logic tree to act intelligently and avoid getting stuck.

🌐 Where to Get BrowseGPT
🔗 Chrome Web Store – BrowseGPT

🛠 GitHub Repository (code + examples): github.com/evinism/browsegpt

💬 You must allow it to control a new tab for it to function. It won't work in your existing browsing session.

💡 Power Tips for Best Results
🔁 Keep commands simple and specific:
"Search budget smartphones on Flipkart." works better than "Can you help me find a good phone please?"

🧠 Use action verbs like:
search, find, click, go to, compare, open, scroll, read

📁 Don’t try to multi-task too much. One intent at a time works best.

🧪 How to Use It
Install BrowseGPT from Chrome Web Store

Open the extension and start a command:

“Find best graphic design laptops under $1500 on Amazon”

Watch as it opens a new tab, performs the task, and gives you the result
